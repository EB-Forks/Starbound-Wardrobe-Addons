# Wardrobe Add-ons

This repository houses mods that serve as addons for the Wardrobe mod. To use these addons, users must have both the Wardrobe mod and the mod specific to the addon.

* [Wardrobe Mod](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe)
  * [Releases](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe/releases)

## Native Support

The below mods work together with the Wardrobe without an add-on. The items will be available in the Wardrobe just by having the mod installed!

| Mod | Author | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Felin Costumes+ | [Kawa](https://community.playstarbound.com/members/kawa.112963/) | [PlayStarbound](https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/felin-costumes.2925/)<br/>[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729427301) |

## Contributing

We'd love some help, and there's various ways to do so!

* **Suggest a mod.** Want to see a mod supported? Let us know by creating a new issue. Make sure there isn't already a suggestion open though! Please provide a link to the mod (preferably both PlayStarbound and Steam).

* **Report issues.** Does an add-on no longer work? Are the items in an add-on outdated? Please create an issue and we'll try to get the add-on updated as soon as possible.

* **Add a Wardrobe item file to your own mod.** The best way to support the Wardrobe is by supporting it in the actual target mod itself. Information can be found on the [Wardrobe Item Fetcher Wiki][wifWiki]. If a mod supports the Wardrobe natively, let us know on the Issues page and we'll add it to the [Native Support](#native-support) list.

* **Create your own add-on.** Add an add-on yourself by cloning this repository and creating a pull request! You can use an existing add-on as a template. For help with creating the items file, check out the [Wardrobe Item Fetcher Wiki][wifWiki].  
If you're not the author of the mod, please first ask for permission! Licenses are also a good way to tell whether an add-on is acceptable.

* **Update outdated add-ons.** Is an add-on outdated? You can update it yourself! Clone the repository, run the Wardrobe Item Fetcher script and push the commit. Create a pull request and we'll try to accept the update as soon as possible.
