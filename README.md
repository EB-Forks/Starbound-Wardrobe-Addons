# Wardrobe Add-ons

This repository houses mods that serve as add-ons for the Wardrobe mod. To use these add-ons, users must have both the Wardrobe mod and the mod specific to the add-on.

* [Wardrobe Mod](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe)
  * [Releases](https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-Wardrobe/releases)

## Native Support

The below mods work together with the Wardrobe without an add-on. The items will be available in the Wardrobe just by having the mod installed!

## Contributing

We'd love some help, and there's various ways to do so!

* **Suggest a mod.** Want to see a mod supported? Let us know by creating a new issue. Make sure there isn't already a suggestion open though! Please provide a link to the mod (preferably both PlayStarbound and Steam).

* **Report issues.** Does an add-on no longer work? Are the items in an add-on outdated? Please create an issue and we'll try to get the add-on updated as soon as possible.

* **Add a Wardrobe item file to your own mod.** The best way to support the Wardrobe is by supporting it in the actual target mod itself. Information can be found on the [Wardrobe Item Fetcher Wiki][wifWiki]. If a mod supports the Wardrobe natively, let us know on the Issues page and we'll add it to the [Native Support](#native-support) list.<br/>
If you aren't planning on updating your clothing any time soon, you could also just take the wardrobe files from the add-on and put them in your mod!  
Make sure to add the `Wardrobe` to your metadata `includes` for the patch to work!

* **Create your own add-on.** Add an add-on yourself by cloning this repository and creating a pull request! You can use an existing add-on as a template. For help with creating the items file, check out the [Wardrobe Item Fetcher Wiki][wifWiki].  
If you're not the author of the mod, please first ask for permission! Licenses are also a good way to tell whether an add-on is acceptable.

* **Update outdated add-ons.** Is an add-on outdated? You can update it yourself! Clone the repository, run the Wardrobe Item Fetcher script and push the commit. Create a pull request and we'll try to accept the update as soon as possible.
